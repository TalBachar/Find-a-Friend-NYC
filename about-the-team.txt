Tal Bachar:
I am excited about this project since I did not get a chance to work on my own project that
involves several technologies at once. I a certain that after this project I will be much
more confident in my skills as a programmer, and also learn some new skills relating to CS.
Alexander Shmarkatyuk:
This looks like a very promising project. Team looks good too. Hopefully we'll have fun and
make something great, and useful to people.
Fredy Camas:
what I'm looking so far is to work and learn from my teammates, I kind of feel behind because
have not been programming for several years. I am exited about this project as well, I hope to 
learn many new things.
